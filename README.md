### Grid 12 Boxes

#### Task 1:

*   Make the parent element a grid container.
*   Set 4 rows and 4 columns of equal size on the container. Size them so that each takes up all of it's available space.
*   Give all items a border.

#### Task 2:

You NOW have an empty row at the bottom of your container. Select items and span them across columns and rows in order to fill that empty row.

* **Note**: only span 2 columns OR 2 rows at a time.

*   Images for reference:
